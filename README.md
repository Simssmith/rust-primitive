# Facepunch Rust Primitive Server Config
Facepunch Rust private server configuration. 
Real scarcity survival primitive medieval solo/duo inspired by Mountain Men TV Series. 

## Server philosophy
Removed most high tech gears, weapons and kept primitive items to keep the game slow and challenging.  Reduce plant growth, spawn rate. Adjusted animal loot table so each animal plays a role either cloth, leather, meat, etc.  Added some default blueprint for everyone and removed ones related to advance items.
